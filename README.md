# AI-Bots-Learn-Chrome-Dino-Game
AI bots with Artificial Neural Network Cognition learn how to play the offline Google Chrome Dinosaur Game. 
The project is separated into two parts:
* The Google Chrome Dino game has been recreated using Python Pygame.
* The AI bots are deployed using Python-NEAT - a neuroevolution technique from the research done by Kenneth O. Stanley et al.

Run main.py to start the simulation.
